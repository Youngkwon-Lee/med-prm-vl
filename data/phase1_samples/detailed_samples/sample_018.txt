His vitals and physical are normal except for an exudative pharynx and an enlarged spleen. Monospot test comes back positive and the student is told not to participate in contact sports for a month. What is the most likely causative agent and which immune cell does it affect?

OPTIONS:
  A. Cytomegalovirus; T-cells
  B. Epstein-Barr virus; B-cells
  C. Group A Streptococcus; Neutrophils
  D. Streptococcus; Macrophages
  E. Epstein-Barr virus; T-cells

Correct Answer: B
Model Answer: B
Is Correct: True

STEP-BY-STEP SOLUTION WITH PRM SCORES:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Step 1] PRM: hard=1, soft=1.000
Step 1:  The patient's symptoms, including sore throat, fatigue, body aches, exudative pharynx, and an enlarged spleen, suggest an infectious origin. The monospot test, also known as the heterophile antibody test, is often used to diagnose a specific viral infection. ки

[Step 2] PRM: hard=1, soft=1.000
Step 2:  The patient's age and presentation also point towards a viral etiology, as the immune responses of children and adolescents can lead to complications. ки

[Step 3] PRM: hard=1, soft=1.000
Step 3:  The most common cause of a positive monospot test is the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which is a common virus that causes infectious mononucleosis. ки

[Step 4] PRM: hard=1, soft=1.000
Step 4:  EBV primarily targets B-cells, a type of lymphocyte, and causes a characteristic immunosuppression, which can explain the patient's fatigue and body aches. ки

[Step 5] PRM: hard=1, soft=1.000
Step 5:  Therefore, the most likely causative agent is Epstein-Barr virus, and it affects B-cells.  The answer is B. ки
