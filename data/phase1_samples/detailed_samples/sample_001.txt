QUESTION:
A 40-year-old male with Down syndrome is brought to your clinic by his mother. She reports that over the past few months he has started having difficulty managing his daily routine at his assisted-living facility and no longer seems like himself. She says that last week he wandered away from the facility and was brought back by police. Additionally, he has stopped taking his regular antiepileptic medication, and she is concerned that he might have a seizure. TSH is checked and is normal. Which of the following is most likely to be responsible for this man's current presentation?

OPTIONS:
  A. Expansion of trinucleotide repeats
  B. Abnormal protein metabolism
  C. Hormone deficiency
  D. Premature degradation of a protein
  E. Nutritional deficiency

Correct Answer: B
Model Answer: D
Is Correct: False

STEP-BY-STEP SOLUTION WITH PRM SCORES:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Step 1] PRM: hard=1, soft=0.125
Step 1:  The patient is a 40-year-old male with Down syndrome who is experiencing a decline in functioning, increased wanderlust, and stopped taking his medication. This suggests that the underlying condition may be related to his Down syndrome, as people with Down syndrome are at a higher risk for various age-related conditions. ки

[Step 2] PRM: hard=1, soft=0.188
Step 2:  Down syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21 (or a significant part of it), which leads to various metabolic changes. One of the metabolic changes associated with Down syndrome is the increased risk of amyloid precursor protein (APP) accumulation due to an extra copy of the APP gene. ки

[Step 3] PRM: hard=1, soft=0.125
Step 3:  As people with Down syndrome age, the accumulation of amyloid beta peptides from the APP protein can lead to the deposition of amyloid plaques in the brain, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. ки

[Step 4] PRM: hard=0, soft=0.000
Step 4:  Alzheimer's disease, in turn, is associated with premature degradation of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) due to the abnormal metabolism of the beta-secretase and gamma-secretase enzymes, which are responsible for the cleavage of the APP protein into toxic amyloid beta peptides. ки

[Step 5] PRM: hard=0, soft=0.000
Step 5:  The symptoms described, including the decline in functioning, increased wanderlust, and stopped medication, are consistent with the progression of Alzheimer's disease in a person with Down syndrome. ки

[Step 6] PRM: hard=0, soft=0.000
Step 6:  Based on this understanding, the most likely cause of the patient's presentation is related to the premature degradation of the protein APP, which is associated with the progression of Alzheimer's disease in individuals with Down syndrome.  The answer is D. ки
