QUESTION:
A 33-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 24 weeks' gestation is brought to the emergency department by her husband for lethargy, nausea, and vomiting for 4 days. She returned from a trip to South Asia 2 weeks ago. Her immunizations are up-to-date and she has never received blood products. Her temperature is 38.9°C (102°F). She is not oriented to person, place, and time. Examination shows jaundice and mild asterixis. Her prothrombin time is 18 sec (INR=2.0), serum alanine aminotransferase is 3911 U/L, and serum aspartate aminotransferase is 3724 U/L. This patient's current condition is most likely associated with increased titers of which of the following serum studies?

OPTIONS:
  A. Anti-HBc IgM
  B. HBsAg
  C. Anti-HEV IgM
  D. Anti-HCV IgG
  E. Anti-HAV IgM

Correct Answer: C
Model Answer: C
Is Correct: True

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP-BY-STEP SOLUTION WITH PRM SCORES:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Step 1] PRM: hard=1, soft=0.812
Step 1: The patient is a 33-year-old pregnant woman presenting with symptoms of lethargy, nausea, and vomiting, along with jaundice and mild asterixis. These symptoms, combined with an elevated temperature and altered mental status, suggest a severe acute illness. ки

[Step 2] PRM: hard=1, soft=0.812
Step 2: The patient's laboratory results show significantly elevated liver enzymes (ALT = 3911 U/L, AST = 3724 U/L), indicating liver injury. The prothrombin time is also elevated (INR = 2.0), suggesting impaired liver function. ки

[Step 3] PRM: hard=1, soft=0.750
Step 3: The patient's recent travel history to South Asia and the presence of symptoms such as jaundice and liver enzyme elevation point towards a viral hepatitis infection as the likely cause of her condition. ки

[Step 4] PRM: hard=1, soft=0.812
Step 4: The patient is pregnant, which makes her more susceptible to severe illness from certain viral infections. Hepatitis E is a major concern in pregnant women, particularly in areas where it is endemic, such as South Asia. ки

[Step 5] PRM: hard=1, soft=1.000
Step 5: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are most consistent with acute Hepatitis E infection, which is typically associated with the presence of Anti-HEV IgM antibodies.  The answer is C. ки
