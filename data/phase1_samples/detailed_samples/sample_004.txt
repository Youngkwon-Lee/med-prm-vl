A 78-year-old Caucasian male actor presents to your office complaining of a dry, non-productive cough. He has a history of hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease and he follows a complicated regimen of medications to treat his multiple co-morbidities. Which of the following medications is most likely to be associated with his chief complaint?

OPTIONS:
  A. Aspirin
  B. Lisinopril
  C. Hydrochlorothiazide
  D. Metoprolol
  E. Nifedipine

Correct Answer: B
Model Answer: E
Is Correct: False

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP-BY-STEP SOLUTION WITH PRM SCORES:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Step 1] PRM: hard=1, soft=0.812
Step 1:  The patient's chief complaint is a dry, non-productive cough, and we need to determine which medication might be associated with this symptom. To do so, we should consider the side effect profiles of the medications listed. ки

[Step 2] PRM: hard=1, soft=0.938
Step 2:  Aspirin, option A, is primarily associated with gastrointestinal side effects, such as stomach upset and bleeding, rather than respiratory issues like a cough. ки

[Step 3] PRM: hard=0, soft=0.000
Step 3:  Lisinopril, option B, is an ACE inhibitor used to treat hypertension and heart failure. While it can cause cough as a side effect, it's more common to cause a productive cough. ки

[Step 4] PRM: hard=1, soft=0.062
Step 4:  Hydrochlorothiazide, option C, is a diuretic used to treat hypertension and edema. It can cause dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and other side effects but is less commonly associated with a dry, non-productive cough. ки

[Step 5] PRM: hard=0, soft=0.000
Step 5:  Metoprolol, option D, is a beta-blocker used to treat hypertension, angina, and heart failure. While it has a wide range of side effects, a dry, non-productive cough is not commonly associated with this medication. ки

[Step 6] PRM: hard=0, soft=0.000
Step 6:  Nifedipine, option E, is a calcium channel blocker used to treat hypertension and angina. One of the common side effects of calcium channel blockers, including nifedipine, is a dry, non-productive cough. ки

[Step 7] PRM: hard=0, soft=0.000
Step 7:  Given the patient's symptoms and medication regimen, the medication most likely associated with his dry, non-productive cough is a calcium channel blocker, particularly nifedipine.  The answer is E. ки
