QUESTION:
A 60-year-old African-American female presents to your office complaining of dysuria, paresthesias, and blurry vision. Her body mass index is 37.2 kg/m2. Which of the following drugs would most significantly increase the levels of C-peptide in the blood when administered to this patient?

OPTIONS:
  A. Metformin
  B. Insulin
  C. Glipizide
  D. Acarbose
  E. NPH

Correct Answer: C
Model Answer: C
Is Correct: True

STEP-BY-STEP SOLUTION WITH PRM SCORES:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Step 1] PRM: hard=1, soft=0.625
Step 1:  The patient's symptoms of dysuria, paresthesias, and blurry vision, along with a body mass index of 37.2 kg/m2, are suggestive of diabetic neuropathy and potentially diabetes mellitus, which is a common condition in African-American females. ки

[Step 2] PRM: hard=1, soft=0.500
Step 2:  The question is asking about a drug that would increase C-peptide levels in the blood, which is a marker of endogenous insulin production. ки

[Step 3] PRM: hard=1, soft=0.750
Step 3:  C-peptide levels typically decrease in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus due to the absence of functioning beta cells in the pancreas. ки

[Step 4] PRM: hard=1, soft=0.875
Step 4:  However, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, who have residual pancreatic function, the administration of certain medications can stimulate the release of insulin from the remaining beta cells, thereby increasing C-peptide levels. ки

[Step 5] PRM: hard=1, soft=0.875
Step 5:  Among the listed options, Glipizide is a sulfonylurea, which stimulates insulin release from the pancreas by binding to ATP-sensitive potassium channels, thereby depolarizing the beta cells and increasing insulin secretion. ки

[Step 6] PRM: hard=1, soft=1.000
Step 6:  This mechanism of action would lead to an increase in both insulin and C-peptide levels in the blood. ки

[Step 7] PRM: hard=1, soft=1.000
Step 7:  Therefore, when administered to this patient, Glipizide would most significantly increase the levels of C-peptide in the blood.  The answer is C. ки
